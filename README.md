# POLLI

POLLI (Practically Organic Language Learning Instrument) is a command-line
language acquisition simulator. The more input it receives, the better
conversation it makes.

In its current form, it does not acquire the rules of syntax but of discourse.
Once a large enough corpus of utterances has accumulated, it should be possible
for such a system to generalize syntactic rules, but that is beyond the scope
of this project.

When you run the script, it will look for JSON data in the accompanying text
files. If these are removed, the script will still function, but it will
require patience as conversational skill is acquired sentence by sentence. What
you put in is what you get back. To end a conversation, simply submit a blank
response. Changes to the data files will only be saved if the program is ended
in this way.

This code is the original work of Cliff Jones (http://CliffJonesJr.com). It may
be modified for personal use, but it should not be used commercially, and
modified versions may not be distributed without accreditation and the author's
express consent. (Polli is my baby, and I want her taken care of.)
